--> The time units it takes is about 2.5-3 times the size of N for each of them,
so the delays incurred scale at best linearly with respect to N = 10,20,40,80;
--> There were special cases when I ran them that it was significantly worse than above.
--> The above numbers are an approximation of what the average seemed to be (I eyeballed it).
